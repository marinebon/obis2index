Open source biodiversity indicator development from open data.

**Expected Outcomes:**

This project aims to advance the state of biodiversity indicators generated from open data.

We will build up a firm, wide foundation of maximally reusable and approachable methods unified under juptyer+github stack.
Accessibility of Jupyter notebooks may be enhanced using mybinder.org, google colaboratory, and|or the Axiom Research Workspace.
The majority of coding will be done in python and R, but julia and others can also be made available.
Deliverables will include modules|libraries, "report" notebooks containing visualization of indicator-adjacent data.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first goal will be to demonstrate an accessible, reproducbile worflow for visualizing a simple biodiversity indicator from taxa occurrence data.
This GitHub+jupyter stack will be the framework within which MBON will maintain the outcomes of this sprint.

An overview of this workflow will be provided to ensure all participants are ready to contribute.
This will include basics of jupyter-powered github repo set up and usage.

The remainder of the sprint will be relatively free-form, moving between ad hoc discussions, workgroups, and presentations.

Github issues, Github discussions, and slack will be utilized extensively for project management.
Pair-programming is highly encouraged; pairings between in-person and virtual paripants are especially encouraged.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each participant will be expected to give a 5-minute show & tell followed by 5-min group discussion.
Included in this discussion should be:

1. Have you used open marine biodiversity data?
2. Which open marine biodiversity data have you used? 
3. How familiar are you with the biodiversity data visualization using open biodiversity data like OBIS/GBIF and others? 
4. What would you like to show?
5. Where should we focus our efforts within this code sprint topic?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some broad areas of development that have already been proposed:

1. spatial mapping of biodiversity
2. biodiversity time-series for a specific region
3. species-specific comparisons
4. "report out" blog post
5. implementation of ES50
6. focus in on use of MoF abundance (or other biodiv indicator) values
7. create a map of sampling bias, identify hotspots, & under-sampled areas
8. 

Please propose ideas and discuss existing ones using the [obis2index github issues tracker](https://github.com/marinebon/obis2index/issues) 

**Skills required:**

Anybody familiar with python/R/julia, OBIS/GBIF/DwC, or biodiversity indices are welcome.

**Difficulty:**

Moderate
